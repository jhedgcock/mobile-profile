# mobile-profile
Here's a mobile profile (320px) I designed and coded with HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery Mobile. I used this as an exercise or "study" on some of the aesthetics and content I'd like to include in my professional portfolio, which is currently in the planning phase.

Credit for jQuery Mobile Touch and Tap Events goes to Ben Major (https://github.com/benmajor/jQuery-Touch-Events.git).


Stay creative and have fun,

Jen
